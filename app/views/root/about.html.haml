      %p The Society for Conservation Biology (SCB) is an international professional organization dedicated to advancing the science and practice of conserving the Earth's biological diversity. SCB has local chapters across the globe that provide opportunities for members to engage in conservation at the local level. 
      %p SCB-TO is one of these local chapters, we strive to build a network of active conservation biologists from the three local academic research universities – University of Toronto, York University and Ryerson University, as well as government, non-government and private agencies operating within the Greater Toronto Area. Our goal is to facilitate the discussion of and solutions to urban conservation biology issues that threaten the function of Toronto’s local ecosystems.
